# PokerAssignment
Using object oriented programming, this poker program deals cards to a number of players and can determine what type of hand (if any) the players have. The program also can take all players cards along with cards from the table and choose exactly three cards from the cards on the table and
exactly two cards from the playerâ€™s hand to form the best hand the player can have.
